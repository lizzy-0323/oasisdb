OasisDB is a high-performance vector database designed for ease of use. It enables efficient vector similarity search for your applications through both standalone deployment and RESTful API interfaces, different from other vector databases, it has not internal network communication, which makes it more lightweight and easier to deploy.

I start this project for all the beginners to learn vector search very easily, and you can see the detail design ideas and related key knowledge in [design](docs/design.md).

## Features

1. Multiple type of vector index: HNSW(hnswlib), IVF(pure Go)
2. Lightweight: standalone deployment as one process, **do not have any internal network communication**.
3. Embedding support: currently support aliyun embedding service, you can refer the embedding docs in [embedding](docs/embedding.md)
4. Easy to use: RESTful API for HTTP and Client SDK for Python
